![Ellen Houghton Skills Word Cloud](https://github.com/annwyl21/annwyl21.github.io/blob/main/images/EllenHoughtonCVwordcloud_oranges_small.jpg?raw=true) 👋

I made a &#128170;bold decision to retrain in tech during the pandemic and taught myself JavaScript, and Python using &#128187;online courses such as Codecademy and &#128214;books such as Vaughan's *Real World Python* and Haverbeke's *Eloquent JavaScript*.

Now, I'm developing this with my growing coding passion. Currently &#127979;enrolled in JustIT's Digital Skills Bootcamp, I'm refining my skills with Docker and GitHub for project management, creating &#128195;individual projects and working in teams to create 🤝collaborative work.

My goal is to be a **Junior Software Developer**. I actively engage in London's tech scene, attending &#128101;meetups like ChatGPT Plugins and PyData, and participating in the Ladies of Code's TDD &#128187;👩‍💻Coding Club. I share these experiences on LinkedIn.
