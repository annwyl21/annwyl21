I made a &#128170;bold decision to retrain in tech during the pandemic and taught myself JavaScript, and Python using &#128187;online courses such as Codecademy and &#128214;books such as Vaughan's *Real World Python* and Haverbeke's *Eloquent JavaScript*.

Now, I'm developing this with my growing coding passion. Currently &#127979;enrolled in JustIT's Digital Skills Bootcamp, I'm refining my skills with Docker and GitHub for project management, creating &#128195;individual projects and working in teams to create ü§ùcollaborative work.
