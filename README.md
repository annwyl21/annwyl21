Graduating &#127979; JustIT‚Äôs Digital Skills Bootcamp in September 2023, I have created a Python Microservice providing endpoints to an SQLite database for CRUD operations and built JavaScript-based websites. 
I also use GitHub extensively; for version control, project tracking, I have shared a gist and used Actions for CI/CD in my projects. 
I have deployed projects on [render](https://github.com/annwyl21/FilmFlixRestAPI) and [replit](https://github.com/annwyl21/yahtzee), my [portfolio](https://annwyl21.github.io/) is on GitHub Pages. I have explored [docker and azure](https://github.com/annwyl21/debt_comparison) to deploy my debt comparison project.
I have created &#128195;individual projects during the bootcamp and worked in teams to create ü§ùcollaborative work in the Ladies Of Code **Test Driven Development Coding Club**.
And I took the opportunity to learn some [Linux command line](https://github.com/annwyl21/special-waffle) too!
