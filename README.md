Graduating &#127979; JustIT‚Äôs Digital Skills Bootcamp in September 2023, I have created a Python Microservice providing endpoints to an SQLite database for CRUD operations and built JavaScript-based websites. I also use GitHub extensively; for version control, project tracking, I have shared a gist and used Actions for CI/CD in my projects. My projects are available on Docker & Azure in containers, on render and replit, and my portfolio is on GitHub Pages. I have created &#128195;individual projects during the bootcamp and worked in teams to create ü§ùcollaborative work in the Ladies Of Code **Test Driven Development Coding Club**.

I am available for work immediately and actively seeking employment as a Junior Software Engineer in the London, UK area.
